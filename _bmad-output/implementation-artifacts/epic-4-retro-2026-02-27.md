## Epic Summaries

### Epic 1 — Project Scaffold & Visual Shell
- Stories 1.1 (HTML structure) and 1.2 (CSS design system) delivered a complete static shell with responsive layout, CSS Grid button arrangement, and design tokens.
- Architecture established: 3-file vanilla stack (index.html / style.css / app.js), IIFE module pattern, single `state` object with `dispatch()`/`render()` cycle.
- `.nojekyll`, `.gitignore`, `README.md` scaffolded early — good foresight for deployment.

### Epic 2 — Calculation Engine
- Stories 2.1 (state machine, number entry, operator selection) and 2.2 (equation completion, animated answer) delivered a fully working 5-phase state machine: `idle → first → operator → second → result`.
- Division-by-zero handled gracefully with "Oops!" display.
- 4-digit maximum enforced at input stage.
- Bounce animation on answer display — child-appropriate delight.

### Epic 3 — Oops Button
- Story 3.1 (short-press, remove last digit) delivered correct backspace behaviour with display-level correction.
- Story 3.2 (long-press, full clear with ring animation) delivered the ring progress animation and 600ms threshold clear — **but the story file's task checkboxes and Dev Agent Record were left unfilled**. Functionality is verified correct by Story 4.3 tests; documentation is incomplete.

### Epic 4 — Accessibility, Testing & Deployment
- Story 4.1: Full keyboard support (digit keys, operator keys, Enter, Backspace, Escape) and ARIA live regions for screen reader compatibility.
- Story 4.2: Touch target audit (all ≥44×44px), visual accessibility audit (colour contrast, focus indicators), page weight confirmed at 25,896 bytes.
- Story 4.3: `test.html` test suite — 18 assertions covering arithmetic correctness, edge cases, oops behaviours. All pass.
- Story 4.4: GitHub Pages deployment live. Privacy validated (zero external requests, zero browser storage). Performance validated (FCP <1.5s, TTI <2s, interaction <100ms, page weight <200KB). Desktop browser testing (Chrome, Edge, Safari) passed. Tablet testing (iPadOS Safari, Android Chrome) deferred — no physical devices available.

## What Went Well

- **Architecture held firm end-to-end.** The 3-file vanilla stack, IIFE module pattern, and single-state-object design never caused problems. No framework churn, no build tool issues.
- **Privacy by architecture.** Zero `fetch`, zero `localStorage`, zero cookies — not enforced by a linter but by design. This made the privacy validation trivial.
- **Page weight discipline.** 25,896 bytes deployed. 87% headroom vs the 200KB budget. No images, no fonts, no CDN calls.
- **Test suite written and passing.** All 18 assertions in `test.html` pass. The DOM stub pattern for headless-friendly testing was a good call.
- **GitHub Pages deployment was frictionless.** `.nojekyll` in place from Story 1.1. No build step. Push main, enable Pages, done.
- **BMAD Method workflow.** Each story had clear acceptance criteria, dev notes with architecture rules, and reference links. This reduced ambiguity and kept the dev agent on track.

## What Didn't Go Well

- **Story 3.2 documentation gap.** Tasks left unchecked (`[ ]`). Dev Agent Record left as `_to be filled by dev agent_`. Story was marked "review" with no documented evidence of completion. The work was done — confirmed by the test suite — but the documentation trail was broken. This is a workflow hygiene failure.
- **No automated cross-device testing.** Tablet testing (Stories 4.4 Tasks 2–3) deferred due to no physical devices. Passing desktop browsers is strong coverage, but the gap is real.
- **No CI pipeline.** `test.html` must be manually opened before each push. This is a human dependency. Fine for this project size, but a latent risk for any future maintenance.
- **4-digit maximum not explicitly stated in PRD.** The constraint was implied and correctly inferred by the dev agent, but an explicit requirement would have been cleaner.

## Action Items (Carry-Forward Lessons)

| # | Action | Owner | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Dev agent must fill task checkboxes and Dev Agent Record before marking story "review" | Process rule | Future projects |
| A2 | Deferred tasks must be explicitly documented in the Dev Agent Record (not left blank) | Process rule | Future projects |
| A3 | Consider GitHub Actions + headless browser for `test.html` if project is ever extended | Winston | If project extended |
| A4 | Run retrospective on all story files at project close to catch documentation gaps before archiving | Bob | Future projects |

## Readiness Assessment

| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All acceptance criteria met | ✓ | Tasks 2–3 of Story 4.4 formally deferred with documented rationale |
| Live deployment verified | ✓ | https://zakzanzak.github.io/Bmadcalculator/ |
| Privacy requirements met | ✓ | Verified by code inspection and DevTools |
| Performance requirements met | ✓ | Lighthouse mobile, page weight, interaction responsiveness |
| Test suite passing | ✓ | 18 / 18 assertions |
| Known bugs | 0 | |
| Open blockers | 0 | |

**Project status: COMPLETE**

## Final Verdict

**Bob (SM):** 4 Epics · 10 Stories · 1 live app · 18 passing tests · 25,896 bytes · 0 external dependencies. The project delivered everything it set out to deliver. Story 3.2's documentation gap is a lesson learned, not a defect. Tablet testing is deferred but not blocking. This project is done.
