## Epic Summary

Epic 1 established the full project foundation: a structurally complete HTML calculator shell (Story 1.1) and a complete CSS design system with responsive layout (Story 1.2). All stories delivered on scope. Both Dev Agent Records are complete.

| Story | Status | Key Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 — Project Scaffold & HTML Structure | review | 7 files created: `index.html`, `style.css` (skeleton), `app.js` (IIFE skeleton), `test.html` (empty skeleton), `.nojekyll`, `.gitignore`, `README.md` |
| 1.2 — CSS Design System & Visual Shell | review | Full `style.css` — 30 CSS Custom Properties in `:root`, 5-column Grid layout, coloured operator buttons, keyframes, responsive breakpoints |

## What Went Well

- **Scope boundary enforcement.** Story 1.1 was structure-only; Story 1.2 was CSS-only. No logic bled across stories. The architecture's file responsibility rules provided a clean wall.
- **`@property --ring-progress` registration.** Registering the custom property as an `<angle>` type unlocked smooth `conic-gradient` animation for the long-press ring. The right call, and it paid dividends in Story 3.2.
- **OG meta tags.** `index.html` includes Open Graph tags for parent/teacher link sharing. A quality-of-life detail from the architecture doc that improves the sharing experience.
- **CSS Custom Property discipline.** 30 tokens in `:root` — all colours and timing values referenced via custom properties, zero hardcoded hex values in component rules. Two additional tokens (`--color-text-on-operator`, `--color-answer-flash`) added during review to maintain this discipline.
- **All tasks checked, Dev Agent Records complete** for both stories.

## What Didn't Go Well

- **`test.html` was a placeholder for three epics.** Created as an empty skeleton in Story 1.1, it sat with a TODO comment until Story 4.3. Not a defect — by design — but it's dead weight in the repo for most of the project lifecycle. Future projects could consider whether to scaffold test files so early.
- **Landscape responsive behaviour explicitly deferred.** Story 1.2 noted that a full side-by-side landscape redesign "can be revisited in Story 4.2." It was, and it was addressed. No problem — just a conscious deferral that added scope to a later story.

## Action Items

None specific to Epic 1. General process improvements captured in the full-project retrospective (epic-4-retro-2026-02-27.md).

## Readiness Assessment

Both stories fully documented and verified. Epic 1 delivered a correct, styled, deployable shell with zero JavaScript behaviour — exactly the intended scope.

**Epic 1 status: COMPLETE**
