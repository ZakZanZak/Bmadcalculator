# Executive Summary

Bmadcalculator is a browser-based calculator web app built exclusively for grade 3 students (ages 8–9). It solves a single, well-defined problem: standard calculator apps overwhelm young learners with buttons and functionality they don't understand and don't need. Bmadcalculator strips the calculator to its grade 3 essentials — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — delivered through a tablet-optimised interface so clear it requires zero adult instruction to operate.

Target users are grade 3 children doing homework on a tablet at home, with a parent nearby but not required to intervene. The secondary user is the parent who discovers, bookmarks, and trusts the app. No download, no account, no login — the app opens in a browser and works immediately.

## What Makes This Special

Every mainstream calculator app is designed for adults. Bmadcalculator is the only calculator designed exclusively for grade 3 — not a simplified adult tool, but a purpose-built child's tool. The core differentiator is **radical feature elimination as a design principle**: no decimal point, no memory functions, no percentage key, no sign toggle. The empty space left by removed buttons makes every remaining button larger, clearer, and more confident.

A persistent full-equation display ("8 + 3 =") lets children self-check before committing to an answer — eliminating the most common source of wrong answers (mis-entry, not mis-thinking). A forgiving "oops" clear button removes the fear of mistakes. An exaggerated animated answer reveal makes the result feel like a reward.

The result: a child picks it up, immediately knows what to press, completes their homework independently, and hands the tablet back with the right answers.
