# Success Criteria

## User Success

**Primary (Child — Jamie):**
- Completes first calculation without adult guidance on first use
- Never encounters a button that confuses or blocks progress
- Self-corrects mis-typed numbers using the equation display before pressing equals
- Completes a full set of homework calculations in a single session without asking for help
- Returns to the app in a subsequent homework session without prompting

**Secondary (Parent — Alex):**
- Opens the app, immediately understands its purpose, and trusts it within 30 seconds
- Bookmarks the URL and shares it with at least one other parent
- Observes child working independently — does not need to intervene during calculations

## Business Success

As a passion project, success is measured by genuine utility and organic reach:

- The app works reliably for every child who uses it — zero calculation errors, zero broken sessions
- Word-of-mouth adoption — at least one unsolicited share or recommendation per week once live
- No complaints from parents about confusing UI, inappropriate content, or broken functionality
- Personal satisfaction: the builder can hand a tablet to a grade 3 child and watch them use it successfully without any instruction

## Technical Success

- Page loads in under 2 seconds on a standard tablet browser on average home Wi-Fi
- Works correctly on Chrome, Safari, and Edge on iOS and Android tablets
- Touch targets meet minimum 44×44px accessibility standard — no accidental mis-taps
- Calculation engine is 100% accurate for all integer operations within grade 3 range (0–9999)
- No data transmitted, stored, or collected — fully COPPA-compliant by design
- Passes WCAG 2.1 AA colour contrast requirements
