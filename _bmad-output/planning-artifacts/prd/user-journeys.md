## Journey 1: Jamie's First Homework Session (Primary — Success Path)

It's 4:30pm on a Tuesday. Jamie's backpack hits the kitchen floor and out comes a maths worksheet — ten addition and subtraction problems. Alex opens the family tablet, navigates to the Bmadcalculator bookmark, and hands it over. "Use this for your sums."

Jamie looks at the screen. There's a big display at the top showing nothing yet, a row of chunky number buttons, four clearly different operator buttons, a big equals button, and a curved arrow in the corner. Jamie doesn't ask what anything does. The buttons are obvious.

First problem: 47 + 36. Jamie taps 4, taps 7 — the display shows "47". Taps the + button — it highlights. Taps 3, taps 6 — the display now shows "47 + 36 =". Jamie pauses, reads it back, confirms it's right, then taps the big equals button. The answer bounces onto the screen: **83**. Jamie writes it down and moves on.

Ten minutes later, the worksheet is done. Alex didn't intervene once.

**Capabilities revealed:** Number input, operator selection, equation display, equals/answer reveal, tablet-optimised layout.

## Journey 2: Jamie Makes a Mistake (Primary — Error Recovery)

Problem seven: 63 - 28. Jamie taps 6, then accidentally taps 9 instead of 3. The display shows "69". Jamie notices — the equation strip shows "69" and that's not right. Jamie taps the curved arrow. "69" disappears. Jamie retypes "63". Crisis averted, no panic, no tears.

Later: Jamie finishes a calculation, sees the answer, and wants to start fresh. Jamie taps the curved arrow again — but nothing clears. Jamie taps it repeatedly. *Oh — it only removes the last digit.* Jamie holds it down. Nothing happens. Jamie looks for another way.

> **Gap identified:** A full-equation clear mechanism is required. Resolved: long-press on the oops button clears the full equation.

**Capabilities revealed:** Last-entry clear, full-equation clear (long-press), error recovery without frustration.

## Journey 3: Alex Discovers and Evaluates (Secondary — Parent Discovery)

It's Sunday evening. Alex searches "simple calculator for kids grade 3" on the phone. Bmadcalculator appears in results. Alex taps the link — the page loads in under two seconds. The interface is immediately visible: big buttons, clean layout, clearly just a calculator. No sign-up prompt, no cookie banner, no ads.

Alex counts the buttons. Numbers, four operators, equals, a clear button. That's it. Alex tries it — types 5 + 3, hits equals, "8" bounces onto the screen. Alex smiles. Bookmarks it, then tomorrow hands the tablet to Jamie.

**Capabilities revealed:** Fast load time, zero-friction first use, no accounts/data collection, trustworthy parent-facing first impression.

## Journey 4: A Teacher Recommends It (Secondary — Teacher/Word-of-Mouth)

Mrs. Chen overhears Alex mention Bmadcalculator at school pickup. She asks for the URL. She opens it on the classroom iPad — works immediately, no IT approval needed. She writes the URL on the classroom whiteboard. Twenty grade 3 students open it on iPads, Android tablets, and a Chrome tablet. It works on all of them consistently.

**Capabilities revealed:** Cross-browser/cross-device compatibility, no-install zero-friction access, consistent layout across tablet types.
