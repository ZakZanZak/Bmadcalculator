# Product Scope

## MVP — Minimum Viable Product

Everything needed for a grade 3 child to complete homework calculations independently:

- Number buttons 0–9 (large, tablet-optimised)
- Four operator buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) — distinct shapes and colours
- Equals button (prominent, animated answer reveal)
- Clear / "Oops" button (removes last entry, forgiving)
- Full equation display (persistent, shows "8 + 3 =" as child builds it)
- Web app — opens in browser, no install, no account
- Tablet-optimised layout (portrait and landscape)
- High contrast, minimum 44px touch targets throughout

## Growth Features (Post-MVP)

When the MVP is proven and stable:

- Sound feedback — distinct tones per button, short jingle on answer reveal
- Object-based number themes — tap to see numbers as visual objects (stars, dinosaurs, fruit)
- Operator shape themes — alternate visual styles for operator buttons
- Classroom display mode — full-screen projector view, one-tap toggle

## Vision (Future)

If Bmadcalculator grows beyond a passion project:

- Curriculum alignment — configurable to match specific grade/country maths standards
- Teacher recommendation flow — shareable link with classroom branding
- Multi-language support for non-English speaking families
